Not committing to any particular language this year. I may switch it up for
some puzzles.

I've added a nix-shell shebang to each file defining all dependencies, so the
solutions can be directly invoked with Nix installed, e.g.:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ ./Day01.hs < inputs/01.txt
#+END_SRC

| Puzzle                                     | Solution                      |
| Day 1: The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation  | [[./2019/Day01.hs][Day01.hs]] |
| Day 2: 1202 Program Alerm                  | [[./2019/Day02.hs][Day02.hs]] |
